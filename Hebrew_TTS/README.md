# 🗣️ Hebrew TTS with Overflow + HiFi-GAN

This project demonstrates a complete Text-to-Speech (TTS) pipeline in **Hebrew**, combining:

- 🌊 [**Overflow**](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) – Tacotron2-based text-to-mel model  
- 🔊 **HiFi-GAN** – high-quality neural vocoder (mel-to-audio)

All notebooks run **fully in Google Colab** — no setup or installation required.
